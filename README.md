# butterchurn-recorder

## [ðŸš€ See it live here](https://vizrecord.app/)

This is a wrapper around [Butterchurn](https://butterchurnviz.com/) (a wonderful Javascript implementation of the venerable [Milkdrop2](https://www.geisswerks.com/about_milkdrop.html) audio visualisation tool),  modified to allow you to record and download audio visualisation videos.

It was built as a means to generate interesting input videos for use with [Parseq](https://github.com/rewbs/sd-parseq), for AI enhancement.

It is a [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/getting-started/what-is-solidstart) app that you can run locally like:

* `npm install`
* `npm run dev -- --open`
